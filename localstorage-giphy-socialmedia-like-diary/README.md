## SPACE

Space is a JavaScript social media ui like space to use as a diary. All it's data is stored locally in the browser.

Bootstrap 5 was used as the design system along with Google Fonts for all the text.

There's also support for Giphy API and Spotify embed. If you have a Giphy key, inform it on the modal that appears every refresh, and if you want to link a Spotify song, playlist, album, etc. you just have to paste the shared link from its platform into the Spotify URL field.
